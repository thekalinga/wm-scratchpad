As a City Employee
  Define Budget deposit Plan that consists of multiple Budget deposit Plan Segments
    Budget deposit Plan Segment consists of
      Amount of wallet balance that can be deposited along with expiration period
      When can it be deposited (1st time deposit time + frequency of deposits and the time of deposit)
      Wallet balance spend restrictions (0 restrictions => can be spent on any vehicle & any amount)
        Vehicle restriction
          0/more MSP + vehicle models + type combinations
        Amount restriction
          Per trip spend restriction
  (NOTE: All Budget deposit Plan schedules aggregated should not result in overlapping vehicle models i.e. they have to be mutually exclusive. This is to avoid ordering these plan schedules etc when trying to find amount for a trip)
  Link & Unlink Budget sharing groups from Budget deposit plan.

Ground rules
  If your [private] group has other members, you cant join any other group
  A user cannot be part of multiple BSGs

No uniqueness constraint on mobile number in User service.
No budget display on vehicles that are displayed on the map by default. Only show vehicle activation quotation (incl budget) when user tries activating vehicles.

1 User -> 1 Budget Sharing Group (Funded)
Multiple Budget Sharing Groups in a single Budget Deposit Plan supported
Anyone has negative balance, the budget from Budget Sharing Groups cannot be used by anyone who is part of this budget sharing group
  [All members of the group are prohibited from joining/leaving the group ]

Transfer the amount from BSG to Trip account as soon as user clicks on end trip (if all other checks are done). May be adjust the a/c balance appropriately (-ve) till user pays for it

Onboard user via SetupIntent in Stripe
Create placeholder for payment via PaymentIntent in Stripe
Pay for the Budget amount immediately & withdraw the amount

We need to ensure accounting service is firewalled at k8s level to talk to only stripe.com & every other domain is blocked.

Create flow charts for
  Points of payment
    Both during payout
